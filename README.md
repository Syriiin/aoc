Advent of code ðŸŽ„

## One-line journal

### 2023

Let's try learning functional programming with Elixir.

#### Day 1

Pattern matching, recursion, pipes!

#### Day 2

Reduce is pretty useful.

#### Day 3

Time to use some more data structures.

#### Day 4

Can't decide if `&get_card_copy_count/1` is elegant or insane...

#### Day 5

Let's try using structs today and OH MY GOD PART 2 OUT OF NOWHERE!

#### Day 6

Oh no part 2 is going to make me do a binary search to find the upper and lowe-... oh nevermind that only took a couple seconds to bruteforce.

#### Day 7

In general I reckon there were more elegant ways to do this but it's alright I guess...

#### Day 8

Spent way too long trying to remember how to calculate LCM by hand before looking it up.

#### Day 9

That's it...?

#### Day 10

That was definitely the ugliest and least optimal code I've written so far... but atleast the output is pretty!

### 2024

Let's try learning vim motions.

#### Day 1

I need more than hjkl. I keep reverting to arrow keys in insert mode...

#### Day 2

I spent WAY too damn long trying to write a non-bruteforce solution.
